## Instructions

### Task Description:

In this application, you are required to create a multi-page application. The application will allow the user to browse books for reading. The user can also borrow a book for reading.

**All the data should be coming from Firebase. Consider this a single user application. So no need to implement Firebase Authentication.**

**Screen1:**

This screen should display a list of books. Choose appropriate data to display in the list item.

**Screen 2:**

When user selects any book from the list, it takes user to this screen which displays all the details of the selected book. You can decide what details you want to display for the book.

User can borrow a book for reading from this screen. User cannot borrow more than three books at a time. If the user tries to borrow more than three books, then display appropriate message to the user.

**Screen 3:**

This screen displays a list of books borrowed by the user for reading. User should be able to return the book from this screen.

### Navigation and Routing:

- Use React Navigation library to implement multi-screen navigation within the application.
- Configure appropriate navigation for navigating between different screens, ensuring a seamless user flow.

### Technical Requirements:

- Apply appropriate styling and design principles to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- Ensure consistency in design elements, typography, colours, and layout across all screens.
- Code must be written either in JavaScript or Typescript.
- Implement state management to handle the data flow between different screens.

### Deliverables:

This lab will be delivered through a text submission. Please deliver:

The project code with Github link (Please keep the repository public so I can access it).
A screen recording of your app execution which should demonstrate all the functionalities and/or errors if any.
